# Oraya Session Log - 2026-02-15

## Status: Active
## Objective: Transition Oraya Landing Page to "Industry Grade" Partner Aesthetic

### 🟢 Completed Tasks
- **Global Gap Compression**: Reduced vertical voids across the entire landing page (Hero, Problem, Manifesto, Transformation, Features, FAQ) by 50-70%.
- **Hydration Fix**: Resolved "Target ref is defined but not hydrated" error in `TransformationSection`.
- **Pricing Overhaul**:
    - Implemented "10x" visual impact for **Architect Elite Swarm** ($49) tier.
    - Added Check/X status indicators for features.
    - Restored cinematic scale for the pricing section.
    - Integrated **"Ask Ora"** neural UI widget.
- **Asset Restoration**: Generated and integrated cinematic portrait for the System Architect.
- **Copy Alignment**: Updated "The Cloud" translucency in Problem header for better authority.

### 🟡 In Progress / Upcoming
- **[AWAITING VIDEO] Agent Swarm Orchestration**: n8n style micro-interactive flowchart for task assignment/self-destruction.
- **Self-Healing UI**: Responsive design mimicking "Knowledge Gaps" and "Reflection" screens (avoiding low-quality screenshots).
- **Multi-Workspace Revamp**: Enhancing project interactivity in `MultiWorkspace.tsx` beyond typewriter effects.
- **Neural Haptics**: Adding industrial grit and interactive velocity-based animations.

### 🔴 Identified Gaps (To be addressed)
- **Compounding Intelligence**: Visualizing the "Learning Loop" benefit.
- **Anticipatory Context**: Showing Ora's dependency mapping before user input.
- **Latency Proof**: Adding real-time comparison vs clunky SaaS wrappers.
