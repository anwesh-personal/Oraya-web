# Oraya Session Log - 2026-02-15

## Status: Active
## Objective: Transition Oraya Landing Page to "Industry Grade" Partner Aesthetic

### 🟢 Completed Tasks
- **Global Gap Compression**: Reduced vertical voids across the entire landing page (Hero, Problem, Manifesto, Transformation, Features, FAQ) by 50-70%.
- **Hydration Fix**: Resolved "Target ref is defined but not hydrated" error in `TransformationSection`.
- **Pricing Overhaul**:
    - Implemented "10x" visual impact for **Architect Elite Swarm** ($49) tier.
    - Added Check/X status indicators for features.
    - Integrated **"Ask Ora"** neural UI widget.
- **Restoration**: Reverted `AgentEcosystem.tsx` to its original layout (as per user feedback) and moved new Orchestration features to a dedicated `AgentOrchestration` section.
- **Agent Swarm Orchestration**: Implemented a micro-interactive n8n-style flowchart showing the spawn -> execute -> self-destruct lifecycle in `AgentOrchestration.tsx`.
- **Self-Healing Engine**: Built a responsive, magical UI mimicking gap identification and reflection steps in `SelfHealingUI.tsx`.
- **Multi-Workspace Revamp**: Enhanced `MultiWorkspace.tsx` with layout transitions and anticipated impact reports.
- **Asset Restoration**: Generated and integrated cinematic portrait for the System Architect.
- **Copy Alignment**: Updated "The Cloud" translucency in Problem header for better authority.
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved `ReferenceError: Zap is not defined` in `AgentEcosystem.tsx` by importing the missing icon.
- **Surgical Refinements**:
    - **Self-Healing UI**: Added hand-drawn arrow and handwriting callout ("Click here") for UX guidance.
    - **Multi-Workspace**: Major layout refactor. Moved live context data directly into the neural bridge interface under the search bar for immediate correlation with the active repo. Simplified the dependency resolver into a minimalist tracker and upgraded the impact report to a cinematic full-width panel.
    - **Master Inventory**: Expanded to the full suite of 20 technical shards and implemented high-impact 1.25x spectral zoom on hover.

### 🟡 In Progress / Upcoming
- **[AWAITING VIDEO] Agent Swarm Orchestration**: n8n style micro-interactive flowchart for task assignment/self-destruction.
- **Self-Healing UI**: Responsive design mimicking "Knowledge Gaps" and "Reflection" screens (avoiding low-quality screenshots).
- **Multi-Workspace Revamp**: Enhancing project interactivity in `MultiWorkspace.tsx` beyond typewriter effects.
- **Neural Haptics**: Adding industrial grit and interactive velocity-based animations.

### 🔴 Identified Gaps (To be addressed)
- **Compounding Intelligence**: Visualizing the "Learning Loop" benefit.
- **Anticipatory Context**: Showing Ora's dependency mapping before user input.
- **Latency Proof**: Adding real-time comparison vs clunky SaaS wrappers.
