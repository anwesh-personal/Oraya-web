# ORAYA — CORE CAPABILITIES 🧠

## 1. The Neural Core (The Brain)
More than just a chatbot, Oraya is a **Cognitive Orchestrator**. 

- **Autonomous Tool Loops**: Oraya can execute up to 25 consecutive system commands (file edits, terminal scripts, web searches) to complete a single user intent.
- **Intent Classification**: Uses a selector logic to identify which platform-specific tool (macOS vs Web) is required before the LLM even responds.
- **Context War Room**: A "magnificient" context strategy that allows for **2M+ token management**.
    - *Assistant Mode*: Balanced (Last 50 msgs).
    - *Brainstorm Mode*: High-Context (Last 100 msgs).
    - *War Room Mode*: Absolute Context (Full history, zero pruning).

## 2. Memory Resonance (The Palace)
Oraya doesn't forget. It builds a **Permanent Knowledge Graph**.
- **FTS5 Integration**: Instant full-text search across every conversation you've ever had.
- **Dream State Processing**: (Phase 3 Architecture) Background intelligence that re-indexes, clusters, and identifies patterns in your digital footprint while your machine is idle.
- **Resonance Scoring**: A 4-factor algorithm combining Semantic Meaning, Keyword Overlap, Emotional Context, and Temporal Decay.

## 3. The Sovereign Vault (Security)
Military-grade data sovereignty is non-negotiable.
- **Sovereign Key Vault**: Hardware-backed storage via OS Keychain.
- **Audit Trails**: Every single tool call (e.g., "Read File") is logged with timestamp, success status, and duration in an immutable audit table.
- **Protocol Tiers (L1-L5)**: 
    - *L1 Observer*: View only.
    - *L3 Operative*: Can modify files.
    - *L5 God Mode*: Full terminal and system access.

## 4. Native Power (OS Integration)
Oraya lives in your machine, not your browser.
- **Native PTY**: Integrated xterm.js terminal with a dedicated PTY manager in Rust.
- **System HUD**: A "Hyperspace" UI (Found in `sentience-brain-advanced.html`) designed for developers.
- **Cross-Platform Kernel**: Single Rust codebase targeting macOS (Metal), Windows (DirectX), and Linux.
